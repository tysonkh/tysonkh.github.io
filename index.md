I am Tyson, an aspiring game developer who has done programming, design, art, and animation on multiple game projects. My first game was created in 2014 and I've made many more games since then. I've used different game engines to make 2D games, but have started to try and make 3D games as well. 

I have used a variety of game engines and software. I first started using GameMaker Studio, but have branched out to Unity and have been slowly learning Unreal Engine. Non-programming software used includes Paint.NET, Krita, and Aseprite.

Regarding programming, I am familiar with GML for GameMaker Studio, C# for Unity, and Blueprint/C++ for Unreal. Based on my prior education, I am also familiar with Python, Java, Bash, Go, and SQL.

This website serves as both a portfolio showcasing my abilities as well as a place to show all my projects. The Notable Projects listed below showcase my latest projects and the best examples of what I can do.
