Welcome to my website! I am Tyson, an aspiring game developer who has worked on various aspects of games including programming, design, art, and animation. I have been working on game projects since 2014. 

I have used a variety of game engines and software. I first started using GameMaker Studio, but have branched out to Unity and have been slowly learning other game engines like Unreal Engine. Non-programming software used includes Paint.NET, Krita, and Aseprite.

Regarding programming, I am familiar with GML for GameMaker Studio, C# for Unity, and Blueprint for Unreal. Based on my prior education, I am also familiar with Python, Java, and Bash. I'm somewhat familiar with Go and SQL as well.
