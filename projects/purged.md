CONTRIBUTION
-----
Learned numerous Unreal Engine features to practice using the engine. 

Visuals include modifying materials retrieved from internet sources to create textures, or creating 2D sprites for enemies and the environment.

ABOUT
-----
For the summer, I wanted to try using Unreal Engine. The main goal was to create a prototype for a game to practice with the various features and workflows involved with the engine. The game concept was attempting to recreate Wolfenstein 3D, with the first level, enemies, and weapons. However, I modified the original idea to include a completely different visual style to practice more with using textures and visuals in the Unreal Engine. I also tried creating custom SFX with a microphone.

For the purpose of learning Unreal, I decided to use Blueprint so I can both get aquainted with the engine's functions, while being able to prototype features faster. I was able to modify the existing Character Controller to suit the needs of the project, while also adding additional features such as a weapon system that would change its values based on the weapon equipped. I also tried to create AI using the Behaviour Tree and Blackboard, allowing enemies to patrol, chase targets, open doors, and attack the player. As part of following the old-school design, I tracked some statistics to show after a player beats the level, this includes the enemies defeated, the amount of treasure found, and the secrets discovered.

For the visuals, I used Paint.NET to create concepts and 2D environment sprites, as well as modify textures when needed. For any enemies, I used Aseprite to animate them. I also practiced using a microphone and Audacity to try creating custom SFX.
