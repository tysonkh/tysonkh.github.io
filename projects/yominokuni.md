Programming, Top-Down

CONTRIBUTION 
-----
Programmed the functionality related to picking up items, storing these items in an inventory, and showing the player what items they’ve currently picked up and how many copies of that item they had.

ABOUT
-----	
Top-down shooter game requiring players to find items to improve their abilities, and surviving long enough to find the exit in a randomly-generated labyrinth of rooms. The main feature is that if the player dies, they can resurrect themselves if they manage to kill the enemies they’ve defeated before they died during the run.
