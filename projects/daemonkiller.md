ABOUT
-----	
Designed and created for the University Capstone, we were tasked to create a game on Unity from start to finish. We maintained all creative rights to the game, but were supervised by a professor who would check on our progress.

Daemon Killer is an action horror game, but during combat players have to pause the game and plan their attacks against enemies. Players are able to use elemental attacks and even shoot things in the environment to their advantage. I originally proposed this game as I wanted to develop a game similar to Parasite Eve and Vagrant Story, which had similar gameplay systems.

I was mainly responsible for programming what the player interacted with in the game, as well as the inventory system for holding items and ammo. I was also responsible for designing, creating, and decorating the levels in the game.	Working with a team of two other members, we brainstormed ideas, and elaborated on the concepts by writing them into a Game Design Document. The team organized schedules, weekly meetups, and wrote the final project document together as part of the capstone requirements. The project planning was done a few months prior to development, but the main development period was roughly 3-4 months.

The game was developed with Unity, source control was also managed by Unity’s internal Unity Collaborate system. Development of the levels was done with a plugin called RealTimeCSG, allowing the ability to quickly “block out” levels for testing and development. Paint.net was used to draw custom UI or sprites, as well as illustrating gameplay ideas or visuals for team members to better understand certain gameplay concepts.
