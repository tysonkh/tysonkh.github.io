ABOUT
-----	
A hero is inflicted with a curse that allows them to absorb souls from two invading worlds. With this power, they must reach the castle to close the portals and save the world. A difficult action platformer that revolved around two resources that must be properly balanced to survive. Enemies would belong to one of two worlds and when killed would drop their souls. Picking up these souls would place more influence to whichever world that enemy belonged to. If players had a majority of a certain type of soul, the world would change; the world change would completely change the behaviour of an enemy.
